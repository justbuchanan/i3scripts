# This script listens for i3 events and updates workspace names to show icons
# for running programs.  It contains icons for a few programs, but more can
# easily be added by adding them to WINDOW_ICONS below.
#
# It also re-numbers workspaces in ascending order with one skipped number
# between monitors (leaving a gap for a new workspace to be created). By
# default, i3 workspace numbers are sticky, so they quickly get out of order.
#
# Dependencies
# * xorg-xprop  - install through system package manager
# * i3ipc       - install with pip
# * fontawesome - install with pip
#
# Installation:
# * Download this script and place it in ~/.config/i3/ (or anywhere you want)
# * Add "exec_always ~/.config/i3/i3-autoname-workspaces.py &" to your i3 config
# * Restart i3: $ i3-msg restart
#
# Configuration:
# The default i3 config's keybindings reference workspaces by name, which is an
# issue when using this script because the "names" are constantaly changing to
# include window icons.  Instead, you'll need to change the keybindings to
# reference workspaces by number.  Change lines like:
#   bindsym $mod+1 workspace 1
# To:
#   bindsym $mod+1 workspace number 1

# Add icons here for common programs you use.  The keys are the X window class
# (WM_CLASS) names (lower-cased) and the icons can be any text you want to
# display.
#
# Most of these are character codes for font awesome:
#   http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/
#
# If you're not sure what the WM_CLASS is for your application, you can use
# xprop (https://linux.die.net/man/1/xprop). Run `xprop | grep WM_CLASS`
# then click on the application you want to inspect.
