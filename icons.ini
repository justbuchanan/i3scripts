[icons]
# Add icons here for common programs you use. The keys are the X window class
# (WM_CLASS) names (lower-cased) and the icons can be any text you want to
# display.
#
# Most of these are character codes for font awesome:
#   https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery
#
# If you're not sure what the WM_CLASS is for your application, you can use
# xprop (https://linux.die.net/man/1/xprop). Run `xprop | grep WM_CLASS`
# then click on the application you want to inspect.
